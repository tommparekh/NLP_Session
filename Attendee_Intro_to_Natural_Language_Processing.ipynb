        "# Take Home Challenge\n",
        "Now that you've been introduced to some of the foundational concepts within the NLP space, we want you to apply what you've learned outside of the workshop environment. We went over the concepts of using \"stop words\" and \"n-grams\" to (hopefully) improve your analysis and the accuracy of your model, but didn't actually apply them yet in this workbook.\n",
        "\n",
        "To do so:\n",
        "- Try removing stop words from your bag of words structure before feeding it into the Multinomial NB classifier. This can be as simple as including an argument for the `stop_words` parameter in the [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) class.\n",
        "- Additionally, try using bigrams to create some additional context for the text that you're analyzing. Again, scikit-learn makes implementing that change relatively easy by including an `ngram_range` parameter within the same [CountVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html#sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer) class.\n",
        "- As you make these changes (and maybe others!), be sure to note how your predictions change accordingly. Do they behave more or less in the ways that you expect?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Bonus Advanced Challenge:**\n",
        "Looking to take your modeling powers to the next level? You're going to want a way to see if the predictions that your model is making are accurate or not. In a practical setting, one of the most common ways to do this is by using [train-test-split](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html).\n",
        " - You will take a large portion of your data (75% by default using `sklearn`) and train your model or have it learn from all of that information.\n",
        " - The other smaller portion (25% in this case) will be held out â€” your model will **not** learn from these data points. Instead, they can be used to simulate real-world or unseen data points.\n",
        " - You will ask your model to make predictions on this smaller set and then compare the predictions made against the actual ground truths to find out how well your model performs.\n",
        " - Some common metrics for classification performance are [accuracy](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score.html#sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score) and inspecting the [confusion matrix](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.confusion_matrix.html).\n",
